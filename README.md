The goal is to understand the role of MHC complex II on AT2 cell in alveoli regeneration.C57BL/6 mice were used.

adult scRNA-seq (PRJNA1251307) : Two genotype (control, AT2 specific MHC2 KO) were used. Mice were infected with influenza A virus (H1N1 strain). 

bulk RNA-seq (PRJNA1251729) : DPI0, 3, 7, 11, 14 (AT2 sorted) (wildtype) Mice were infected with influenza A virus (H1N1 strain). 

neonatal scRNA-seq (PRJNA1251299) : PND1, PND7 (wildtype) 

bulk ATAC-seq (PRJNA1251134) : PND1, PND7 (AT2 sorted) (wildtype)

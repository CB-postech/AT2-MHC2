The goal is to understand the role of MHC complex II on AT2 cell in alveoli regeneration.C57BL/6 mice were used.
adult scRNA-seq : Two genotype (control, AT2 specific MHC2 KO) were used. Mice were infected with influenza A virus (H1N1 strain). 
bulk RNA-seq : DPI0, 3, 7, 11, 14 (AT2 sorted) (wildtype) Mice were infected with influenza A virus (H1N1 strain). 
neonatal scRNA-seq : PND1, PND7 (wildtype) 
bulk ATAC-seq : PND1, PND7 (AT2 sorted) (wildtype)
